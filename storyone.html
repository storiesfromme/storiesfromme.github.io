    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>

New York City, NY 3:20 <br><br><br>

BAM! Joseph woke to the sound of something large and heavy hitting the ground. However, while there are many large and heavy things in NYC this one was not supposed to be here. This was a Cyber Demon whose only intention was to serve his master, unfortunately his master was DANGER, a group of malicious evildoers worldwide. DANGER had constructed this Cyber Demon illegally and (also illegally) airdropped it into New York City. This particular Cyber Demon, also known to the FBI as Threat 18393, is the  most dangerous one of only 5 worldwide. <br><br>
Okay - back up, Joseph is an eleven year old boy attending an FBI training school. He lives in an apartment with 2 of his closest friends from the FBI school. Now that you're caught up, back to the story. <br><br>
He jumped up, grabbed the latest laser blaster (this is only available to top students as it is still being tested and is very expensive), and woke his friends. They raced down the stairs and out onto the streets. The NYC police dept. had managed to keep people off the streets, and had proceeded to try and fight off the Cyber Demon. While they were trained officers, there was only so much they could do to fight off the most dangerous Cyber Demon in history. Cyber Demons are top secret, the FBI has to keep them secret otherwise America would go into a panic. Of course, it’s not easy to keep secret something that just landed in NYC with at least a hundred cameras pointed at it. The way the FBI had decided to deal with this was to block off a radius of 250 yards and turn off all the cameras. After the issue of onlookers was resolved, the FBI called in all of their forces. Armoured cars were arriving by the minute.  People jumped out carrying anything from pistols to assault rifles to laser swords. Each time someone approached the Cyber Demon, however, they got blasted back with a magnetic pulse. When Joseph came out, the street was so crowded with FBI that he couldn’t help. He realized, however, that the Demon was concentrating on the people on the ground. He had an idea. Joseph and his friends took the elevator to the top floor. On the roof, there was a balcony. Once on the balcony, Evan, one of Joseph’s friends, took a shot at the demon, but it was protected by reflective titanium armour. Joseph was able to eventually get a shot into the demon’s eyes, which confused it for long enough for the FBI to take care of it. Unfortunately the demon got away, but was in need of major healing before it could fight again.
